^ This needs to be reverted

See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/docs/UIDS-GIDS.md#notes-on-resolvability-of-user-and-group-names

Instead:

nscd.wants = [ "nss-lookup.target" "nss-user-lookup.target" ];
nscd.before = [ "nss-lookup.target" "nss-user-lookup.target" ];


is there a big difference? Not really; because nscd in our case is _always_ needed anyway
